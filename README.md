# Web 4.0 Manifesto

This repository contains an independent, living specification exploring **Web 4.0** as an agentic, intent-based evolution of the web.

It is not owned by any company, product, or platform.
Any implementation claiming alignment with these ideas must stand on its own merits.

## Contents
- MANIFESTO.md — philosophical framing
- APPENDIX.md — technical primitives
